            <h2>First manned flights</h2>

            <p>
                The first clearly recorded instance of a balloon carrying passengers used hot air to generate buoyancy
                and was built by the brothers Joseph-Michel and Jacques-Etienne Montgolfier in Annonay, France. After
                experimenting with unmanned balloons and flights with animals, the first tethered balloon flight with
                humans on board took place on October 15, 1783.

            <h2>The frameless parachute</h2>

            <p>
                Andr√©-Jacques Garnerin carried out the first jump with a silk parachute on October 22, 1797 at Parc
                Monceau, Paris. Garnerin's first parachute resembled a closed umbrella before he ascended; at a height
                of approximately 3,000 feet he severed the rope that connected his parachute to the balloon, and the
                basket fell to earth. Garnerin emerged uninjured.

            <h2>Over the English Channele</h2>

            <p>
                On January 7, 1785, Jean Pierre Blanchard and Dr. John Jeffries made the first flight over the English
                Channel, traveling from Dover to France. During the crossing the balloon lost altitude, so they began
                tossing everything in the gondola they possibly could, even their clothes. About two hours after take
                off, they crossed the French coast clad only in their underwear.
